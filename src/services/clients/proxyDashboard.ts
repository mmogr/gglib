/**
 * Proxy dashboard client.
 *
 * Unlike every other client in `services/clients/`, this one talks directly
 * to an already-running proxy's own HTTP port — it does **not** go through
 * `getTransport()`/Tauri IPC. The proxy is always a plain HTTP/axum server
 * (see `services/proxyEvents.ts`'s doc comment: "Proxy always uses HTTP/axum
 * (no Tauri commands)"), and its dashboard SSE endpoint lives on the proxy's
 * own port, not the app's own backend API port — the same relationship the
 * CLI's `gglib proxy dashboard` command has to it
 * (`crates/gglib-cli/src/handlers/proxy_dashboard.rs`).
 *
 * @module services/clients/proxyDashboard

/**
 * Subscribe to a running proxy's live dashboard stream via a native
 * `EventSource` connected to `GET /v1/proxy/status/stream`.
 *
 * The server hydrates this stream itself (the first event is always the
 * current full snapshot, followed by live ticks — see
 * `gglib_sse::Broadcaster::subscribe_with_hydration` on the Rust side), so
 * there is no separate initial-fetch step here: the very first `onSnapshot`
 * call already contains complete state.
 *
 * @param host   Proxy host (typically `127.0.0.1`).
 * @param port   Proxy port.
 * @param onSnapshot Called with each decoded snapshot (hydration + every tick).
 * @param onError    Called when the underlying `EventSource` reports an error
 *                    (the browser will keep retrying the connection itself;
 *                    this is purely informational for the UI).
 * @returns An unsubscribe function that closes the `EventSource`. Callers
 *          (see `hooks/useProxyDashboard.ts`) must invoke this on cleanup —
 *          `EventSource` does not close itself when a component unmounts.
