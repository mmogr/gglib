//! Download execution.
//!
//! This module handles the actual download execution via Python subprocess.
//! All Python-related logic is internal to this module.
//!
//! Note: The actual download execution currently lives in `gglib-download::manager::worker`.
//! This module is reserved for future refactoring to extract the Python subprocess logic.
